Sup this is Franz and here i made u guys sum notes on reduxjs/toolkit and next.js

### FIRST: do an NPM RUN DEV to start local server and go explore stuff

### SECOND: explore the stuff in the files themselves

# Reduxjs toolkit

You dont have to follow but yeh i recommend it

Flow:

1. go to store folder then,
2. check index.js then,
3. check counterSlice.js then,
4. check counterActions.js then,
5. go to pages folder and check index.js there,

# Next.js

I just talked about routing and the file structure of next.js since im getting sleepy
but yeh just check the folders and files in the pages directory, i placed some pretty useful notes there.

Oh and check the hello.js file in the api folder in the pages folder

Here some other stuff to research about next.js:

- Page Prerender and Data Fetching

  - getStaticProps
  - getStaticProps w/getStaticPaths
  - getServerSideProps

- API Routing

- New Features of Next 12
